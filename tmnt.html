Rotten Ditching the cheeky, self-aware wink that helped to excuse the concept's inherent corniness, the movie attempts to look polished and 'cool,' but the been-there animation can't compete with the then-cutting-edge puppetry of the 1990 live-action movie.

Critic Peter Debruge
Variety

Fresh TMNT is a fun, action-filled adventure that will satisfy longtime fans and generate a legion of new ones.

Critic Todd Gilchrist
IGN Movies

Rotten It stinks!

Critic Jay Sherman (unemployed)

Rotten The rubber suits are gone and they've been redone with fancy computer technology, but that hasn't stopped them from becoming dull.

Rotten The turtles themselves may look prettier, but are no smarter; torn irreparably from their countercultural roots, our superheroes on the half shell have been firmly co-opted by the industry their creators once sought to spoof.

Critic Jeannette Catsoulis
New York Times

Rotten Impersonally animated and arbitrarily plotted, the story appears to have been made up as the filmmakers went along.

Critic Ed Gonzalez
Slant Magazine

Fresh The striking use of image and motion allows each sequence to leave an impression. It's an accomplished restart to this franchise.

Critic Mark Palermo
Coast (Halifax, Nova Scotia)

Rotten The script feels like it was computer generated. This mechanical presentation lacks the cheesy charm of the three live action films.
