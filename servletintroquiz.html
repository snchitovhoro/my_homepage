            1. What is the difference between a web server and a web container?
            </em>
        </p>
        <p class="a"> A Web Server consits of several parts that control how web users access hosted files
            through a protocol like HTTP.
            Meanwhile a Web Container provides the runtime environment to web applications providing
            naming context and manages the life cycle of a web app.
            A Web Container is part of the web server.

                2. What is a servlet?
            </em>
        </p>
        <p class="a"> According to Oracle.com A servlet is a Java programming language class
            that is used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed
            by means of a request-response programming model.

3.          How do web servers and web containers interact with servlets?
            </em>
        </p>
        <p class="a"> Any request that comes through goes through the web server, a web Server is very
            efficient in serving static files, when some logic is needed or we serve some dynamic
            content in the application, then this will be delegated to servlets.

4.          Who creates request objects?
            </em>
        </p>

        <p class="a"> The web container creates the request objects.
        </p>

        5. What are the states in the servlet lifecycle?
            </em></p>
        <p class="a"> There are 3 states in the servlet lifecycle
            <ol>
        <li>New state, the servlet is in a new state when the servlet instance is created</li>
        <li>Ready state, the servlet is in a ready state after the init method has been invoked.
            All the work that the servlet does is invoked in this state</li>
        <li>End state, when the web container is shut down it invokes the destroy method,
            when this happens, the servlet is in the end state </li>
    </ol>
        </p>
    </li>

        6. Who calls init and when?
            </em>
        </p>
        <p class="a"> The web container calls the init method only once after creating the servlet instance.
            The init method is used to initialise the servlet
        </p>
    </li>

            <em>
    7. Which of init, service, and doGet should you override?
            </em>
        </p>
        <p class="a"> Override doGet, this is where all data processing to answer the request is done. <br/>
            The init method is called by the web container to put the servlet into service,you generally
            override this method only if you have resources like database connections that need to be
            initialised, in this case you override the init() and call the super.init(servletConfig) inside
            this method<br/>
            The service method routes the incoming request to either the doGet or doPost methods
            depending the HTTP transfer method of the request so generally there is no need to
            override this method</br>
            The init method

        8. In what sense are servlets multi-threaded?
            </em>
        </p>
        <p class="a"> Multiple requests to the same servlet are executed in parallel, i.e. a new thread
            of the service method is called by the web container for every request and executed in parallel.        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <em>
        9. What are the implications of this for servlet instance variables?
            </em>
        </p>

        <p class="a"> If the servlet instance variables are to be accessed by the service method,
            they need to be thread safe, else the service method should not access these member variables
            at all.
